# WikiPulseAngular

This project is a reimplementation of [WikiPulse](https://wikipulse.com/) using the angular framework.
I discovered the usage of a spiral to represent periodic date thanks to this hackernews post :
I liked very much the idea and decided to study it by reimplementing it with a familiar framework. 

## Demo

A demo is available on [spiral.jonathanpastor.fr](https://spiral.jonathanpastor.fr) .

## Run the project

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
